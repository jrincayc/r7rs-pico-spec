# r7rs-tiny-spec
Tiny version of revised‚Å∑ report on the algorithmic language scheme

This designed as a smaller version of the Scheme spec, suitable for use when the
small version is still too big.

r7rs-tiny (tr7rs) is designed to be small enough that a small group or a single 
person working on it part time can implement it in a few months.

In addition, the denotational semantics are considerably simpler than the semantics
for r7rs-small which aids in understanding it.
