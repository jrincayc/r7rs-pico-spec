\extrapart{Introduction}

\label{historysection}

Programming languages should be designed not by piling feature on top
of feature, but by removing the weaknesses and restrictions that make
additional features appear necessary.  Pico Scheme continues this
tradition by creating a smaller subset of \rsevenrs{} that can be easily
implemented and understood, yet remains a full programming
language. Features including side effects and continuations that add
complication to both the denotational semantics and the implementation
are removed. In this report \rsevenrs{} is used to refer to the ``small''
language.



\medskip

We intend this report to belong to the entire Scheme community, and so
we grant permission to copy it in whole or in part without fee.  In
particular, we encourage implementers of Pico Scheme to use this report as
a starting point for manuals and other documentation, modifying it as
necessary.
